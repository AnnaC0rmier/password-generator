## Description ##

As a developer I wanted to create a web application that would create a random password for its user. When the generate password button is clicked, the user is prompted with a series of
questions about what character types they want to be included in their password, and how many characters it should be. Once the user answers all of the questions, their newly generated
password is displayed on the screen
